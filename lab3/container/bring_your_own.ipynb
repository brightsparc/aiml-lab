    "# Part 1: Packaging and Uploading your Algorithm for use with Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "### An overview of Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with Docker already, you can skip ahead to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many data scientists, Docker containers are a new concept, but they are not difficult, as you'll see here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Docker provides a simple way to package arbitrary code into an _image_ that is totally self-contained. Once you have an image, you can use Docker to run a _container_ based on that image. Running a container is just like running a program on the machine except that the container creates a fully self-contained environment for the program to run. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host environment, so the way you set up your program is the way it runs, no matter where you run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is more powerful than environment managers like conda or virtualenv because (a) it is completely language independent and (b) it comprises your whole operating environment, including startup commands, environment variable, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways, a Docker container is like a virtual machine, but it is much lighter weight. For example, a program running in a container can start in less than a second and many containers can run on the same physical machine or virtual machine instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker uses a simple file called a `Dockerfile` to specify how the image is assembled. We'll see an example of that below. You can build your Docker images based on Docker images built by yourself or others, which can simplify things quite a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker has become very popular in the programming and devops communities for its flexibility and well-defined specification of the code to be run. It is the underpinning of many services built in the past few years, such as [Amazon ECS].\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker uses Docker to allow users to train and deploy arbitrary algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Amazon SageMaker, Docker containers are invoked in a certain way for training and a slightly different way for hosting. The following sections outline how to build containers for the SageMaker environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful links:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Docker home page](http://www.docker.com)\n",
    "* [Getting started with Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)\n",
    "* [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)\n",

    "\n",
    "### How Amazon SageMaker runs your Docker container\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you can run the same image in training or hosting, Amazon SageMaker runs your container with the argument `train` or `serve`. How your container processes this argument depends on the container:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you are building separate containers for hosting (as per this example), you can define a program as an `ENTRYPOINT` in the Dockerfile and ignore (or verify) the first argument passed in. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running your container during hosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Hosting has a very different model than training because hosting is reponding to inference requests that come in via HTTP. In this example, we use our recommended Python serving stack to provide robust and scalable serving of inference requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Request serving stack](stack.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This stack is implemented in the sample code here and you can mostly just leave it alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker uses two URLs in the container:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/ping` will receive `GET` requests from the infrastructure. Your program returns 200 if the container is up and accepting requests.\n",
    "* `/invocations` is the endpoint that receives client inference `POST` requests. The format of the request and the response is up to the algorithm. If the client supplied `ContentType` and `Accept` headers, these will be passed in as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The container will have the model files in the same place they were written during training:\n",
    "\n",
    "    /opt/ml\n",
    "    └── model\n",
    "        └── <model files>\n",

    "### The parts of the sample container\n",
    "\n",
    "In this `container` directory are all the components you need to package the sample algorithm for Amazon SageMager:\n",
    "\n",
    "    .\n",

    "Let's discuss each of these in turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __`Dockerfile`__ describes how to build your Docker container image. More details below.\n",
    "* __`build_and_push.sh`__ is a script that uses the Dockerfile to build your container images and then pushes it to ECR. We'll invoke the commands directly later in this notebook, but you can just copy and run the script for your own algorithms.\n",
    "* __`app`__ is the directory which contains the files that will be installed in the container.\n",
    "* __`local_test`__ is a directory that shows how to test your new container on any computer that can run Docker, including an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. Using this method, you can quickly iterate using small datasets to eliminate any structural bugs before you use the container with Amazon SageMaker. We'll walk through local testing later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple application, we only install five files in the container. You may only need that many or, if you have many supporting routines, you may wish to install more. These five show the standard structure of our Python containers, although you are free to choose a different toolset and therefore could have a different layout. If you're writing in a different programming language, you'll certainly have a different layout depending on the frameworks and tools you choose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files that we'll put in the container are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __`nginx.conf`__ is the configuration file for the nginx front-end. Generally, you should be able to take this file as-is.\n",
    "* __`predictor.py`__ is the program that actually implements the Flask web server and the decision tree predictions for this app. You'll want to customize the actual prediction parts to your application. Since this algorithm is simple, we do all the processing here in this file, but you may choose to have separate files for implementing your custom logic.\n",
    "* __`serve`__ is the program started when the container is started for hosting. It simply launches the gunicorn server which runs multiple instances of the Flask app defined in `predictor.py`. You should be able to take this file as-is.\n",
    "* __`wsgi.py`__ is a small wrapper used to invoke the Flask app. You should be able to take this file as-is."

    "### The Dockerfile\n",

    "The Dockerfile describes the image that we want to build. You can think of it as describing the complete operating system installation of the system that you want to run. A Docker container running is quite a bit lighter than a full operating system, however, because it takes advantage of Linux on the host machine for the basic operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Python science stack, we will start from a standard Ubuntu installation and run the normal tools to install the things needed by scikit-learn. Finally, we add the code that implements our specific algorithm to the container and set up the right environment to run under.\n",
