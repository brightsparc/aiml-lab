    "R is a popular open source statistical programming language, with a lengthy history in Data Science and Machine Learning.  The breadth of algorithms available as an R package is impressive, which fuels a growing community of users.  The R kernel can be installed into Amazon SageMaker Notebooks, and Docker containers which use R can be used to take advantage of Amazon SageMaker's flexible training and hosting functionality.  This notebook illustrates a simple use case for creating an R container and then using it to train and host a model.  In order to take advantage of boto, we'll use Python within the notebook, but this could be done 100% in R by invoking command line arguments.\n",

    "- The IAM role arn used to give training and hosting access to your data. See the documentation for how to create these.  Note, if more than one role is required for notebook instances, training, and/or hosting, please replace the boto regexp with a the appropriate full IAM role arn string(s)."

    "This notebook showcases a straightforward example to train and host an R algorithm in Amazon SageMaker.  As mentioned previously, this notebook could also be written in R.  We could even train the algorithm entirely within a notebook and then simply use the serving portion of the container to host our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other extensions could include setting up the R algorithm to train in parallel.  Although R is not the easiest language to build distributed applications on top of, this is possible.  In addition, running multiple versions of training simultaneously would allow for parallelized grid (or random) search for optimal hyperparamter settings.  This would more fully realize the benefits of managed training."
